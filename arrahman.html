            A.R. Rahman, often referred to as the "Mozart of Madras," is an internationally acclaimed Indian composer, singer, and music producer. Born on January 6, 1967, in Chennai (formerly Madras), India, Rahman is known for his work in the Indian film industry, as well as in international cinema and music.
            
            Early Life:
            Rahman, born as Allah Rakha Rahman, showed an interest in music from an early age. His father was a composer, and he was influenced by various musical traditions, including Indian classical, Western classical, and world music. After his father's death, Rahman turned to music more seriously. He initially studied at the Madras Conservatory of Music and later trained under renowned musicians in both Western and Indian classical music.
